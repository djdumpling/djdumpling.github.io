title: "spectral editing of activations for privacy"

(Coming soon!) We investigate methods for suppressing personally identifiable information (PII) that LLMs memorize and may reveal during inference. We reproduce the activation-patching privacy neuron editing technique from prior work and test a replacement using spectral activation editing (SEA). Using the Enron dataset and GPT-Neo, we measure targeted PII suppression, untargeted PII exposure, and model utility.
