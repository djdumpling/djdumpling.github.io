title: "activation engineering for privacy protection in LLMs"

(Coming soon!) Using the Enron dataset and GPT-Neo, we investigate methods for suppressing personally identifiable information (PII) that LLMs memorize and may reveal during inference. We reproduce the activation-patching privacy neuron editing (APNEAP) technique and test a replacement using spectral activation editing (SEA).
