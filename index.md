      Hey! I'm Alex Wa, a 2nd year Math and CS double major at Yale, Soma Fellow, and YES Scholar. My research currently span RL and NLP, and I'm also interested in ML systems and model architecture. Currently, I'm developing RL environments in <a href="https://app.primeintellect.ai/dashboard/environments" target="_blank">Prime Intellect</a>'s RL Residency and researching RL4LLMs and rubrics as rewards with the <a href="https://nlp.cs.yale.edu/" target="_blank">Yale NLP lab</a>. Previously, I've done research in geometric algebra (APOLLO Labs), algebraic topology (SUMaC '23), abstract algebra (SUMaC '22), and biostatistics (Emory).

      In my free time, I enjoy <a href="https://www.instagram.com/alex_wa_art/" target="_blank">drawing</a>, drinking coffee or tea, playing board games, and exploring other ML and math disciplines.
