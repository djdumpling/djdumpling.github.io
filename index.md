      Hey! I'm Alex Wa, a 2nd year Math and CS major at Yale and YES Scholar. My research currently span RL and NLP, and I'm also interested in LLM architecture and ML systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently, I'm developing RL environments in <a href="https://app.primeintellect.ai/dashboard/environments" target="_blank">Prime Intellect</a>'s RL Residency, researching RL4LLMs and rubrics as rewards with the <a href="https://nlp.cs.yale.edu/" target="_blank">Yale NLP lab</a>, and researching web agents for human behavior prediction. Previously, I've done research in rubrics (<a href="https://www.judgmentlabs.ai/" target="_blank">Judgment Labs</a>), geometric algebra (APOLLO Labs), algebraic topology (SUMaC '23), abstract algebra (SUMaC '22), and biostatistics (Emory).

      In my free time, I <a href="https://www.instagram.com/alex_wa_art/" target="_blank">draw</a>, run <a href="https://www.theveritassearch.com/" target="_blank">The Veritas Search</a>, play board games like Catan, and enjoy photography.
