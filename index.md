      Hey! I'm Alex Wa, a 2nd year Math and CS double major at Yale and a YES Scholar. My research interests currently span RL, NLP, and diffusion, and I'm especially interested in model architecture and how models work under the hood. Previously, I've done research in geometric algebra (APOLLO Labs), algebraic topology (SUMaC '23), abstract algebra (SUMaC '22), and biostatistics (Emory).

      In my free time, I enjoy <a href="https://www.instagram.com/alex_wa_art/" target="_blank">drawing</a>, drinking coffee or tea, and exploring other ML and math disciplines.
