    Hey! I'm Alex Wa, a 2nd year Math and CS major at Yale and a YES Scholar. My research interests span RL, NLP, and interpretability, but I've also done research in algebraic topology, abstract algebra, and in the BME space.

In my free time, I enjoy <a href="https://www.instagram.com/alex_wa_art/" target="_blank">drawing</a> and exploring other ML and math disciplines.
