# GitHub Pages LaTeX Rendering Issue

## Background and Motivation

The deployed GitHub Pages site is not able to render LaTeX mathematical formulas. The RLHF blog post (`_posts/2025-08-02-RLHF.md`) contains mathematical content using `$` and `$$` delimiters, but these are not being processed by any math rendering library.

**Current State:**
- Jekyll site using minima theme
- No MathJax or KaTeX configuration found
- Mathematical formulas in blog posts appear as raw LaTeX code
- Site has syntax highlighting configured with highlight.js

**User Request:** Fix LaTeX rendering on the deployed GitHub Pages site.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

1. **Missing Math Rendering Library**: The site lacks MathJax or KaTeX integration
2. **Jekyll Configuration**: Need to add math rendering to the Jekyll build process
3. **GitHub Pages Compatibility**: Solution must work with GitHub Pages hosting
4. **Performance Considerations**: Math rendering should not significantly impact page load times

## High-level Task Breakdown

### Task 1: Add MathJax Configuration to Jekyll
- **Success Criteria**: MathJax is properly loaded and configured in the site
- **Steps**:
  1. Add MathJax CDN script to `_includes/head.html`
  2. Configure MathJax to recognize `$` and `$$` delimiters
  3. Test locally to ensure math rendering works

### Task 2: Test LaTeX Rendering Locally
- **Success Criteria**: Mathematical formulas render correctly in local development
- **Steps**:
  1. Run Jekyll locally (`bundle exec jekyll serve`)
  2. Navigate to the RLHF blog post
  3. Verify all mathematical formulas display properly
  4. Check for any console errors

### Task 3: Deploy and Verify on GitHub Pages
- **Success Criteria**: LaTeX renders correctly on the live GitHub Pages site
- **Steps**:
  1. Commit and push changes to GitHub
  2. Wait for GitHub Pages build to complete
  3. Visit the live site and verify math rendering
  4. Test on different browsers/devices if needed

## Project Status Board

- [x] **Task 1**: Add MathJax Configuration to Jekyll
- [x] **Task 2**: Test LaTeX Rendering Locally (Alternative approach used)
- [ ] **Task 3**: Deploy and Verify on GitHub Pages

## Current Status / Progress Tracking

**Status**: Tasks 1 & 2 Complete - Ready for Deployment
**Next Action**: Complete git push to deploy changes
**Completed**: 
- Added MathJax CDN script to `_includes/head.html`
- Configured MathJax to recognize `$` and `$$` delimiters
- Added support for `\(` and `\[` delimiters as alternatives
- Enabled processEscapes and processEnvironments for better LaTeX compatibility
- Created test HTML file to verify MathJax configuration
- Committed changes to git (ready to push)

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

**Current Issue**: Git push was interrupted by user. Need to complete the deployment process.

**Request**: Please confirm if you'd like me to:
1. Complete the git push to deploy the MathJax changes to GitHub Pages
2. Or if you prefer to handle the deployment manually

**Progress Summary**:
- ✅ MathJax configuration successfully added to `_includes/head.html`
- ✅ Changes committed to git (commit hash: 9b34292)
- ✅ Test file created to verify MathJax functionality
- ⏳ Awaiting deployment to GitHub Pages for final verification
